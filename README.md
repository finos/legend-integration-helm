Short blurb about what your project does.

## Installation

OS X & Linux:

npm install my-crazy-module --save

edit autoexec.bat
```

## Usage example

A few motivating and useful examples of how your project can be used. Spice this up with code blocks and potentially screenshots / videos ([LiceCap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) is great for this kind of thing).
